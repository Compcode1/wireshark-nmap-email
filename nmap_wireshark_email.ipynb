    "Before Gmail's mail server could encrypt and transmit email data, the **Dell (Chrome) needed to determine the IP address of Gmail‚Äôs mail server (`mail.google.com`)**.  \n",
    "This process, known as **DNS resolution**, involves querying a **DNS server** to translate a domain name (`mail.google.com`) into an IP address.\n",

    "- **Query Sent:** `mail.google.com`\n",

    "---\n",

    "## **Step 3: Implications of DNS Resolution**\n",
    "### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Why DNS Resolution Matters for Email Transmission**\n",
    "- Before an email can be sent, the **sender's computer must resolve the recipient's mail server address**.\n",
    "- **DNS lookups introduce potential delays**, so Google's use of **fast IPv6 resolution optimizes email delivery.**\n",
    "- The resolved **IP address (`2607:f8b0:4005:802::2005`) is part of Google‚Äôs global mail infrastructure**, meaning emails sent via Gmail route through Google's massive data center network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2Ô∏è‚É£ What This Tells Us About Gmail‚Äôs Email Routing**\n",
    "- Gmail‚Äôs email servers are distributed **across different IPs based on load balancing**.\n",
    "- Even though we resolved **one IP (`2607:f8b0:4005:802::2005`)**, subsequent queries **could return different IPs** depending on network conditions.\n",
    "- **DNS caching** may cause future email transactions to skip resolution if an IP is already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Network Analysis Considerations**\n",
    "- **DNS Spoofing Risks:** If an attacker manipulates DNS responses, they could redirect email traffic to a **malicious server**.\n",
    "- **Encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT) Impact:** Some modern browsers use **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**, which prevents capturing DNS queries in Wireshark. In this case, we were able to capture it because standard **UDP-based DNS resolution was used**.\n",
